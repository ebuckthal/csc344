The Z-transform for feed-formed filters

Y(t) = (sigma)x [ kx X(t-x) ]

examples --
   Y(t) = X(t)                identity filter
   Y(t) = X(t) + X(t-1)
   Y(t) = X(t) + X(t-10000)   delay   
   Y(t) = 3X(t) + 14X(t-1)


You'll see that these linear filters affect different frequencies differently

Ae^(i * (2PI / SR) * omega * t) ------ SR == number of samples, omega = number of rotations of our samples (only real portion), A = phase shift and amplitude

Z = e^(i 2PI/SR omega)

multiplying a phasor by a vector -- phase offset by theta, amplitude multiplied by amplitude of vector
