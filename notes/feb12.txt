need to normalize gain on our lowpass filter. The gain at 0 is 

Y = X [ 1 / ( 1 + Bz^-1 + Cz^-2 + Dz^-3 + Ez^-4 ) ] AT z = 1 IS [ 1 / ( 1 + B + C + D + E ) ] = Gain_p

Y = [ 1 + Bz + Czz + Dzzz + Ezzzz ] = X => Y = X - BzY - CzzY - DzzzY - EzzzzY

- clipping
   - hard: chopped at specific line
   - soft (overdrive?): a more gentle slope from min to max output amplitude
   - flange
   - chorus
   - time dilation (frequency and time are related so you hae to cheat)
      - take sound, divide into overlapping pieces, then play end to end so it is slightly longer
      - perhaps envelope them so it's not so choppy
   - fourier-based techniques
