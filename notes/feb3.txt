CONVOLUTION

f(x) = impulse response
s(x) = signal

convolution - h(x)

h(t) = sum [ f(x) * s(t-x) ] over all integers x OR sum [ f(t-y) * s(y) ] over all integers y
   THUS it is symmetric (if we substitute y for x)

complexity = O(m*n) 
   m = length of sample (~ 4 second = 176K samples)
   n = length of signal (~ 10 seconds = 441K samples)
   m * n = 7.7 Billion multiplications

The perfect way of simulating any linear filter, but it is not feasible in terms of computation

Time to simulate!
